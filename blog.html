            <h3>Initial Design</h3>
            <img src="./Assest/initial.jpg" alt="" width="70%">
            <p>Boeing refined its response to the revamped Airbus A350 XWB with three 777X models, targeting a firm configuration in 2015, flying in late 2017 or 2018, and entering service by 2019. The 407–passenger 777-9X should stretch the 777-300ER by four frames to 250 ft 11 in (76.48 m) in length, for a 759,000 lb (344 t) maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and powered by 99,500 lbf (443 kN) engines, targeting per-seat 21% better fuel burn and 16% better operating cost. The smaller 353-seat 777-8X was to stretch the 777-200ER by ten frames to 228 ft 2 in (69.55 m), with a 694,000 lb (315 t) MTOW and 88,000 lbf (390 kN) turbofans to compete with the A350-900 with improvements over the -200ER like the 777-9X over the 777-300ER.[4] A 8LX with the 9X MTOW would have a 9,480 nmi (10,910 mi; 17,560 km) range. The current 777-200LR/300ER have a 775,000 lb (352 t) MTOW. A new carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) wing with a wingspan of 213 or 225 ft; 2,560 or 2,700 in (65 or 68.6 m) with blended winglets, or up to 233 ft 5 in (71.1 m) with raked wingtip provide for a 10% larger wing area. It would fall into ICAO aerodrome code F like the 747-8 and A380 but with 22 ft 6 in (6.9 m) folding wingtips it would stay within the 213 ft 4 in (65.02 m) code E like current 777s. Horizontal stabilizers would be extended.</p>

            <h3>Engine Selection</h3>
            <img src="./Assest/engine.jpg" alt="" width="60%">
            <p>The General Electric GE90-115B of the earlier 777-200LR and -300ER variants has a 42:1 overall pressure ratio and 23:1 HP compressor ratio. Rolls-Royce Plc proposed its RB3025 concept with a 132 in (335 cm) fan diameter, a 12:1 bypass ratio, and a 62:1 overall pressure ratio, targeting a fuel burn of more than 10% lower than the GE90-115B and 15% lower than its Trent 800 powering the 777; the RB3025 concept has a composite fan, a core derived from the Trent 1000, and advanced HP materials. Pratt & Whitney responded with a 100,000 lbf (440 kN) thrust PW1000G architecture. GE Aviation proposed the GE9X with a 128 in (325 cm) diameter fan, a 10:1 bypass ratio, a 60:1 overall pressure ratio, and 27:1 HP compressor ratio for a 10% fuel burn reduction. In March 2013, Boeing selected the GE9X with a 132 in (335 cm) fan. It is the largest fan made by GE. In the rest of 2013, thrust was bumped to 102,000 and 105,000 lbf (450 and 470 kN) to support the MTOW growing from 769,413 to 775,000 lb (349,000 to 351,534 kg) and increasing the payload-range, with even 108,000 lbf (480 kN) envisioned.</p>

            <h3>Launch</h3>
            <img src="./Assest/launch.jpg" alt="" width="20%">
            <p>On September 18, 2013, Lufthansa became its launch customer by selecting 34 Boeing 777-9X airliners, along with 25 Airbus A350-900s to replace its 22 747-400s and 48 A340-300/600s for its long-haul fleet. At the November 2013 Dubai Airshow, the -8X for 350 passengers over a 9,300 nmi (17,200 km) range and the -9X, seating more than 400 over 8,200 nmi (15,200 km) were launched with 259 orders and commitments for US$95 billion at list prices. This was the largest commercial aircraft launch by dollar value with Emirates ordering 150, Qatar Airways 50, and Etihad Airways 25, in addition to the September 2013 Lufthansa commitment for 34 aircraft. Boeing dropped the variants' "X" suffix, while keeping the 777X program name at the 2015 Dubai Airshow. In June 2017, Lufthansa was considering delaying 777X deliveries and could limit its -9 orders to 20 and order more A350s.[15] Due to its large order, Emirates will become the first operator instead of Lufthansa.</p>

        <div class="production common">
            <h3>Production</h3>
            <img src="./Assest/prod.jpeg" alt="" width="70%">
            <p>Boeing began construction on a new 367,000 sq ft (34,100 m2) composites facility in St. Louis to be completed in 2016, to build 777X parts with six autoclaves for the wing and empennage parts, starting in 2017. The 787 'surge' line at the Everett factory would be converted into a 777X early production line by the end of 2015. Boeing built a new 1,300,000 sq ft (120,000 m2) building adjacent to the Everett factory, with a 120 ft (37 m) autoclave,and a robot to wind fiber for the wings. The first 777X was planned to be built on the ex-787 "surge" line. The -9 firm-configuration was reached in August 2015 and assembly of the initial aircraft was to begin in 2017 for a December 2019 introduction advanced from the previously scheduled 2020. With a current 777 production rate of 100 per year, 380 on order at the end of 2013 and no orders at the February 2014 Singapore Airshow, bridging the gap to the 777X deliveries starting from 2020 is a challenge: to stimulate orders, sales of current 777s can be paired with 777Xs and used 777s can be converted to freighters to be sold and stimulate new sales.</p>

        <div class="testing common">
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <img src="./Assest/test.jpeg" alt="" width="70%">
            <p>The first test flight took place on January 25, 2020, at 10:09 a.m. from Paine Field in Everett, and landed in Boeing Field in Seattle after 3 hours and 52 minutes. The second 777X first flew on April 30, by which point the first had accumulated nearly 100 hr of exploring the flight envelope. Two more 777-9s are expected to be added to the test program, aiming for certification in 2021. After the first delivery was pushed back from 2021 to 2022, the third aircraft made its maiden flight on August 3; it is slated for avionics systems, APU, flight loads and propulsion performance tests.</p>

            <img src="./Assest/wings.png" alt="" width="70%">
            <p>The 777X has a new longer composite wing with folding wingtips. Based on the 787 wing but with less sweep, the new wing has a higher lift-to-drag ratio, aspect ratio increased from 9:1 to 10:1, area increased from 4,702 to 5,562 sq ft (436.8 to 516.7 m2), and usable fuel capacity increased from 320,863 to 350,410 lb (145,541 to 158,943 kg). Folding wingtips are a first for commercial aviation. To stay within the size category of the current 777 with a less than 213 ft (65 m) wingspan, it features 11 feet (3.5 m) folding wingtips with the folding wingtip actuation system made by Liebherr Aerospace. The mechanism was demonstrated for Aviation Week at the Boeing Everett Factory in October 2016; the folding movement should be complete.</p>

            <img src="./Assest/interior.jpg" alt="" width="60%">
            <p>The internal cabin width is increased from the previous 777 models' 231 to 235 in (587 to 597 cm) through thinner interior cabin walls and better insulation to allow 18.0 in (46 cm) wide seats in 10-abreast economy. The 777X will feature cabin design details requiring structural changes that were originally introduced on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner: larger windows, higher ceilings, more humidity and lowered cabin altitude to 6,000 ft (1,800 m). Its flight deck is similar to the 787 cockpit with large displays and head-up displays, controls for the new folding wingtips, and touchscreens replacing cursor control devices. Windows are dimmable.</p>

            <h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>
            <img src="./Assest/eff.jpg" alt="" width="20%">
            <p>For the longer 777-9, new engines should improve fuel consumption by 10%, with the longer, carbon-fiber wings adding an estimated 7% improvement. As 4 to 5% of fuel savings is lost from the 12 tons heavier basic structure of the larger airliner, the net fuel efficiency gain is projected to be 12 to 13%. Ten-abreast seating instead of nine with a longer fuselage enable a reduction in fuel burn per seat of 20% compared to the 365–seat 777-300ER. The longer-range 355–seat 777-8 should have a 13% improvement in fuel consumption with 10 fewer seats than the −300ER. Boeing forecast a 33% better cost per seat than the 747-400 and 13% better than the 777-300ER. Its maximum takeoff weight is targeted for 775,000 lb (351.5 t) like the 777-300ER but Boeing hopes to have at least a 10,000 lb (4.5 t) margin at introduction. Boeing predicts the -8 to be 4% more fuel efficient and cost effective than the A350-1000, while the -9 would be 12% more fuel efficient and 11% more cost effective. Lufthansa, when it ordered both, stated the Airbus A350-900 and the 777-9X will consume an average of 2.9 L/100 km per passenger.</p>
